Earth is approached by the two opposing factions in a galatic rivalary to join them. 


Emergence
-----------------------

Emergence is the faction with highly developed telpathy sckils.
They are a group of species which are evolutionarily very behind 
Humans, but thanks to their highly developed skills at telepathy,
their ability to massivley cordinate and control as extremly large 
groups, has alllowed them to build technogy far superior to ours.

They work in groups, with indivdual members of group being separate 
oranisms but with limited individuality. With each groups 
being telepatheticallly connected to the group, they can cordinate with
an effeciveness matched only by that between your left and right hand.

They value equality above all others. All oragnisims in Emergence are part of the whole, no one is superiar.

Hierarchy
---------------------------

Hierarchy is the other faction, the species in Hierarchy are 
in a scrict hierarchy, with a heirarchy rigidly defined, and 
headed by the Founders. The organisms in Hierachy are generally 
much more advanced evolutionarily than humans and scpecies from 
emergence. However technicqlly they are about the same level with emergence.

Hierachy values individuality above all other. They refuse to use telpathy, as 
telepthy by value of it nature is incompatibe with hierarchy and individuality.
